## Lab Specific Tasks
These tasks can be completed at the end of the setting up your Rasberry Pi Z2W.

The following tasks ask you to add screenshots to your downloaded folder. Look up how to take screenshots in Ubuntu. Then you can click and drag your saved PNG to the VS Code folder in the left file explorer pane. Remember to rename your files.

1. If you haven't already, connect to your Pi Z2W with using the SSH extension on VSCode. Open a terminal in VSCode. Execute the `htop` command and take a screenshot. Save it to this folder as `htop.png`.

2. Execute the `hostname` command and take a screenshot. Save it to this folder as `hostname.png`.

3. Take a screenshot like the last one in the lab writeup that shows the folder tree and terminal. Save it to this folder as `vscode.png`.
